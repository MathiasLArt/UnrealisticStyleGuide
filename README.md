# Unrealistic Style Guide

In the developer universe, there is an oft-cited mantra that there is no such thing as
"good" or "bad" style. Instead, it has been said:

> "Arguments over style are pointless. There should be a style guide, and you should follow it."

I disagree. Having come from a legal background, I can say with certainty that there
is such a thing as good and bad style, just as there is good and bad writing. Indeed,
quality lawyers spend their working lives trying to become better writers (until they
become judges, at which point all writing skill and common sense goes out the window).

There are sentences, words, and formats that convey meaning well, and then there are
sentences, words, and formats that obfuscate, confuse, and mislead. The same can be
said for software development. After all, the end user is the same in each domain: human.
As humans building for other humans (including ourselves), the empathetic thing to
do is to maintain good style to the extent we can.

With that said, the following style rules are designed as a lowest common denominator.
Each project, like each essay or brief, will have its own unique classes and logical
structure that defy one-size-fits-all classification. However, each project should strive
to follow these basic guidelines. (*Much thanks are owed to Michael Allar for creating
the Gamemaking UE4 Style Guide, which served as the basis for this*)
